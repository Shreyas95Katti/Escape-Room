# Escape-Room
This is an intutive game designed to test user's knowledge on the Sherlock Holmes series. The backend includes python problem solving skills and the GUI has been enhanced using Pygame and PyQt5 python libraries. The user may begin the game by running the "Starting_Screen.py", after understanding the back story and the rules of the game, the user can enter the first level. The user is expected to navigate through the map and reach the target destination to view the level's clue. Upon giving the correct answer the user is lead to the further levels. There are 5 such levels that the user must pass to finally finish the game. The game ends with an epilogue and an ending screen. This project is my 1st semester Computer Science subject final project, and it has been termed as the best project amongst the class!!
